title: International research stay in Montréal
---

I spent the summer doing a research stay in Montréal at the [noiseLab](https://ebitzlab.com) working on an experimental task to understand the variability of people making decisions in a stochastic environment. It was a very fruitful stay and collaboration that leaves a great opportunity to pursue plenty interesting questions! Thanks Becket!
