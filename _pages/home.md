- September 2022: I spent the summer doing a research stay in Montr√©al at the [noiseLab](https://ebitzlab.com) working on an experimental task to understand the variability of decision making in humans. It was a very fruitful stay and collaboration that leaves a great opportunity to pursue many interesting questions! Thanks Becket!
- May 2022: I will give a talk about our entropy seeking principle in the [2022 Barcelona Computational, Cognitive and Systems Neuroscience conference](https://www.crm.cat/barccsyn-2022/), to be held on May 26-27, 2022.
