# News
- March 2024: I joined the [Noise Lab](https://ebitzlab.com) as a postdoc to work on intrinsic motivation and exploration in humans. Excited to see where this goes!
- November 2023: Our paper ["Empowerment, Free Energy Principle and Maximum Occupancy Principle compared"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OcHrsQox0Z) was accepted in the [Information-Theoretic Principles in Cognitive Systems](https://sites.google.com/view/infocog-neurips-2023) 2023 NeurIPS workshop.
- June 2023: I defended my PhD thesis, entitled ["Constraints and rewards in behavior and optimal decision making"](https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/688642#page=1), with "Sobresaliente Cum Laude" mention.
- June 2023: I gave a talk at the [*Active learning in brains and machines*](https://conect-int.github.io/talk/2023-06-12-conect-workshop-on-learning/) CONNECT workshop in Marseille about our work on the maximum occupancy principle. 
- December 2022: I presented a poster about our work on the maximum occupancy principle at the [Deep Learning Barcelona 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/dlbcn2022/home?authuser=0) conference.
- September 2022: I spent the summer doing a research stay in Montr√©al at the [noiseLab](https://ebitzlab.com) working on an experimental task to understand the variability of decision making in humans. It was a very fruitful stay and collaboration that leaves a great opportunity to pursue many interesting questions! Thanks Becket!
<!-- - May 2022: I will give a talk about our entropy seeking principle in the [2022 Barcelona Computational, Cognitive and Systems Neuroscience conference](https://www.crm.cat/barccsyn-2022/), to be held on May 26-27, 2022. -->
