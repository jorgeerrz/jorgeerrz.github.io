# News
- July 2024: Our [Maximum Occupancy Principle paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49711-1) is now published in Nature Communications!
- June 2024: Our ["Value emerges from imperfect memory"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.26.595970.abstract) paper got accepted in the [Simulation of Adaptive Behavior](https://sab2024.socsci.uci.edu) conference, to be held in September in Irvine, CA.
- May 2024: I presented a poster and gave a spotlight talk at the [Fifth International Convention on Mathematics Of Neuroscience and AI](https://www.neuromonster.org)
- May 2024: I got best [poster](/assets/images/print_poster_neuromonster.pdf) award at the UNIQUE Student symposium.
- March 2024: I joined the [Noise Lab](https://ebitzlab.com) led by Pr. Becket Ebitz as a postdoc to work on intrinsic motivation and exploration in humans. Excited to see where this goes!
- November 2023: Our paper ["Empowerment, Free Energy Principle and Maximum Occupancy Principle compared"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OcHrsQox0Z) was accepted in the [Information-Theoretic Principles in Cognitive Systems](https://sites.google.com/view/infocog-neurips-2023) 2023 NeurIPS workshop.
- June 2023: I defended my PhD thesis, entitled ["Constraints and rewards in behavior and optimal decision making"](https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/688642#page=1), with "Sobresaliente Cum Laude" mention.
- June 2023: I gave a talk at the [*Active learning in brains and machines*](https://conect-int.github.io/talk/2023-06-12-conect-workshop-on-learning/) CONNECT workshop in Marseille about our work on the maximum occupancy principle. 
<!-- - December 2022: I presented a poster about our work on the maximum occupancy principle at the [Deep Learning Barcelona 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/dlbcn2022/home?authuser=0) conference. -->
<!-- - September 2022: I spent the summer doing a research stay in MontrÃ©al at the [noiseLab](https://ebitzlab.com) working on an experimental task to understand the variability of decision making in humans. It was a very fruitful stay and collaboration that leaves a great opportunity to pursue many interesting questions! Thanks Becket! -->
<!-- - May 2022: I will give a talk about our entropy seeking principle in the [2022 Barcelona Computational, Cognitive and Systems Neuroscience conference](https://www.crm.cat/barccsyn-2022/), to be held on May 26-27, 2022. -->
