# About
I am currently a PhD student in the [Theoretical and Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.upf.edu/web/tcn) lab at the [Center for Brain and Cognition]("https://www.upf.edu/web/cbc"), at the [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) in Barcelona, Spain.

I am interested in the role of agency in biology, and how this concept fits within our physical knowledge of the world.
In particular, I am interested in the part that constraints play in the types of behaviours we find in living, adaptive agents. Theory-wise, I am drawn towards optimal control, reinforcement learning, information theory, and related fields.

I did my Bachelor's degree in Physics at UNAM (México) and a Master's degree in Condensed Matter Physics at the Université de Sherbrooke (Québec).

# Research
During my PhD, I have been working on the [breadth-depth dilemma](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/33/19799), a bounded-rationality model to investigate the influence of sampling resource constraints (e.g. time, precision, compute) on decision-making strategies.

Recently, I have been working on conceptualizing behavior as a manifestation of "exploration" as the only objective function. More details to come soon. In the meantime, I leave these cartpole animations of agents "trying" to do different things.
