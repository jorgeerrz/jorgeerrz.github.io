I am currently a postdoc at the [Noise Lab](https://ebitzlab.com) led by Pr. Becket Ebitz at the Université de Montréal.
<!-- I am interested in the role of agency in biology, and how this concept fits within our physical knowledge of the world.
In particular, I am interested in the part that constraints play in the types of behaviours we find in living, adaptive agents. Theory-wise, I am drawn towards optimal control, reinforcement learning, information theory, and related fields. -->

I did my Bachelor's degree in Physics at UNAM (México), a Master's degree in Condensed Matter Physics at the Université de Sherbrooke (Québec), and a PhD in Information and Communication Technologies (Neuroscience) at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Spain).

I play competitive Ultimate (frisbee), I am a typical passionate coffee nerd, but above all, I am a parent, and that alone brings me all the joy in the world.
